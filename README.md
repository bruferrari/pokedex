# Ignus Digital Recruitment Test

## Getting Started
These instructions will guide you to clone and setup the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
* Xcode 9.3
* Homebrew
* Bundler

### Installing
After clone the repository, please run the following script in your preferred terminal application.

`./bin/setup`

### Running 
To run the application just open `Pokedex.xcworkspace` and play.

## What you need to do:
Youâ€™re receiving a initial project that the main goal is list and detail pokemons. For now we are just listing in a very poor UI but we already have an UI available at Zeplin!

In the backend, -we are using this GraphQL api, feel free to consult the schema: http://graphql-pokemon.now.sh/.

**To complete this test you need to:**
- Update the UI of Pokemon list based on received prototype in Zeplin.
- Create the detail screen based on received prototype.
- Test your code. We already have some tests using Quick, but if you prefer you can use XCTest.
- You can add any other dependency you need to complete your project.

You have a two-week period to do this, but if you need more time do not hesitate to ask. When you are finished **you don't need to submit a PR**, just send us an email and we will analyze your fork.

Please, **do not open pull requests nor create a public repository** as your code will become available to other users. If you open a pull-request or create a public repository your fork will be deleted and you will be **automatically disqualified**.
